# Billin code challenge 2021 edition

Welcome to the **Billin code challenge 2021 edition**. We look forward to reading your quality code!!

Please find below the _instructions_ and the _key points_ for doing the exercise.

# Instructions

The challenge explanation is very simple, you have to develop an invoice importer. For this purpose you'll find a test file called `importer.test.ts`. You must get it running in green. And this is all.

We provide you with the two CSV files you will need to get the tests running. Please see the `files` folder.

In the section **Tests** you will find the instructions to run the tests.

As you can see, the code files are in **Typescript**. If you never have programmed in this language, this is a great opportunity to start. Hey, remember that it is just Javascript.

# What we will evaluate in the challenge

- We highly value code **readability**, so please pay close attention to this.
- The coode should be **well structured**.
- The code should be **maintainable**.
- The code should be **extensible**.
- The code should follow **SOLID** principles.
- We love very much **Clean Code**.
- Unit tests are welcome.

# Tests

- Single run testing, also this is your basic CI/CD script for testing. If this exits with a 0, then tests are good (including code coverage).
- `npm test`
- Development testing mode (watch all files or a single file)
- `npm run test:watch`
